# TicTacToeApp

This project will offer two modes to play the TicTacToe game:

You can play this game with a friend.
You can play directly with the computer.
We will implement game rules so that if you choose to play with the computer, it will follow the rules defined for this game.

The app will consist of multiple screens.

- On the first screen, you will choose the game mode, deciding whether you want to play with a friend or the computer.
- On the second screen, you will need to enter your name. This screen will have multiple safety checks to validate user input.
- On the third screen, you will need to enter your friend's name. Again, this screen will have multiple safety checks.
- On the fourth screen, the user will need to select a team: "Team Heart" or "Team Star". There are two team options to choose from for this game.
- On the fifth screen, we will gather all the data passed from the previous screens and draw the game layout. We will also have a Game Rules class where we define the rules to declare a winner.
